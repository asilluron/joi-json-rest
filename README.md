# joi-json-rest
A Confidence-based JSON Format and compiler for Joi. Magically transforms JSON into REST-ready Joi schemas.

The purpose of this project is to provided an opinionated format that makes it easy to define shared schemas between HTTP Verbs (PUT, GET, POST, etc) from a single file. If you have any other use for JSON to JOI, I highly encourage that you check out: https://github.com/lightsofapollo/joi-to-json-schema
